            illness(name: "Abuse, Mental and Physical", description: "The trauma from mental and physical abuse can result in self-defeating behavior that can undermine success later in life. Through their powerful effect on the limbic system of the brain (the center of stored memories and emotions), essential oils can help release pent-up trauma, emotions, or memories. All memories alter the RNA and DNA and create a blueprint in the DNA. This is why trauma imprinting can be passed from generation to generation. Always start with Frankincense.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Sacred Frankincense","Frankincense", "Idaho Balsam Fir", "Sandalwood", "Melissa", "Ylang Ylang", "Amazonian Ylang Ylang"], suggestedOilBlends: ["Trauma Life", "SARA", "Release", "Acceptance", "Forgiveness", "Surrender", "Humility", "White Angelica", "Inner Child", "Harmony", "Hope", "Tranquil Roll-On", "Valor", "Valor Roll-On", "Peace & Calming", "The Gift", "Oola Grow", "Common Sense"]),
            illness(name: "Acidosis", description: "Acidosis is a condition where the pH of the blood serum becomes exclusively acidic. This condition should not be confused with an acid stomach. Acidic blood can stress the liver and eventually lead to many forms of chronic and degenerative diseases. Dietary changes will help in raising the serum pH (making it more alkaline). Cleansing is an essential dietary step in balancing pH.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Peppermint", "Fennel", "Tarragon", "Lemon"], suggestedOilBlends: ["DiGize", "EndoFlex", "BLF", "JuvaCleanse"]),
            illness(name: "Addictions", description: "Many foods and plants -- such as tobacco, caffeine, drugs, alcohol, breads, sugar, and other sweeteners -- create chemical dependencies.\n\nCleansing and detoxifying the liver is a crucial first step toward breaking free of these addictions. Alkaline calcium can help bind bile acids and prevent fatty liver. A colon and tissue cleanse is also important.\n\nA body lacking in sufficient enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients may also play a part in some addictions. Blue Agave, Yacon Syrup, Stevia, maple syrup, honey, molasses, and other natural sweeteners are good substitutes for sugar, which should be restricted in a diet.\n\nThe Thieves oil blend has been very helpful in curbing an addiction. One or two drops on the tongue are very sufficient to stop the onset of a craving. JuvaTone, JuvaPower, and JuvaCleanse may be used long term to help detoxify the liver. They suppress the addiction and eventually change the addiction blueprint in the cells of the body.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Orange", "Ledum", "Fennel", "Tarragon"], suggestedOilBlends: ["GLF", "Thieves", "Harmony", "Peace & Calming", "JuvaCleanse", "JuvaFlex"]),

While these hormones are crucial to sound health in normal amounts, their unchecked overproduction can cause as much harm as their underproduction.\n\nAlthough Cushing's disease can be caused by a malfunction in the pituitary, it is usually triggered by excessive use of immune-suppressing corticosteroid medications, such as those used for asthma and arthritis. Once these are stopped, the disease often abates.\n\nThe key to reducing excess cortisol is often reducing stress.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Canadian Fleabane", "Spearming", "Dorado Azul", "Sacred Frankincense", "Frankincense", "Idaho Balsam Fir"], suggestedOilBlends: ["EndoFlex", "Exodus II", "Peace & Calming", "Acceptance", "Grounding", "Harmony", "DiGize"]),

Craving: A strong compulsion, or need, to drink alcohol\n2. Impaired control: The inability to limit drinking\n3. Physical Dependence: Inability to stop drinking without experiencing withdrawl symptoms such as nausea, shakiness, sweating, and anxiety\n4.

            illness(name: "Alkalosis", description: "Alkalosis is a condition where the pH of the intestinal tract and the blood become excessively alkaline. While moderate alkalinity is essential for good health, excessive alkalinity can cause problems and result in fatigue, depression, irritability, and sickness.\n\nThe best way to lower the internal pH of the body is to eat a high protein diet (meat, eggs, dairy, seeds, nuts, legumes, etc.).", suggestedSingleOils: ["Peppermint", "Lemon", "Orange", "Tarragon", "Fennel", "Ginger", "Patchouli", "Lemongrass"], suggestedOilBlends: ["DiGize", "GLF", "EndoFlex"]),
            illness(name: "Allergies", description: "Allergies are a result of the response to many different situations. They can be triggered by food, pollen, environmental chemicals, dander, dust, insect bites, to name just a few.\n\nFood Allergies:\nFood allergies are different from food intolerances. Food allergies involve an immune system reaction, whereas food intolerances involve gastrointestinal reactions and are far more common.\n\nFor example, peanuts often produce a lifelong allergy due to peanut proteins being targeted by immune system antibodies as foreign invaders. In contrast, intolerance of pasteurized cow's milk that causes cramping and diarrhea is due to the inability to digest lactos (milk sugar) because of a lack of the enzyme lactase.\n\nFood allergies are often associated with the consumption of peanuts, shellfish, nuts, wheat, cow's milk, eggs, and soy. Infants and children are far more prone to have food allergies than adults, due to the immaturity of their immune and digestive systems.\n\nA thorough intestinal cleansing is one of the best ways to combat most allergies. Start with ICP, ComforTone, Essentialzyme, Essentialzymes-4, JuvaTone, and Life 5.\n\nHay Fever\nHay fever is an allergic reaction triggered by airborne allergens (pollen, animal hair, feathers, dust mites, etc.) that cause the release of histamines and subsequent inflammation of nasal passages and sinus-related areas. A more serious form of respiratory allergy is asthma, which manifests in the chest and lungs.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Fennel", "Eucalyptus Blue", "Lavender", "Ocotea", "Roman Chamomile", "Marjoram", "Sacred Frankincense", "Frankincense"], suggestedOilBlends: ["DiGize", "Harmony", "JuvaCleanse", "Valor", "Valor Roll-On", "R.C.", "Raven"]),

            illness(name: "Anthrax", description: "The anthrax bacterium is one of the oldest and deadliest diseases known. There are three predominant types:\n-External, acquired from contact with infected animal carcasses\n-Internal, obtained from breathing airborne anthrax spores\n-Ballefield, developed for biological warfare that is a far more lethal variety\n\nWhen the airborne variety of anthrax invades the lungs, it is 90 percent fatal unless antibiotics are administered at the very beginning of the infection, but antrax often goes undiagnosed until it is too late for antibiotics.\n\nExternal varieties of anthrax may be contracted by exposure to animal hides and wool. While vaccinations and antibiotics have stemmed anthrax infection in recent years, new strains have developed that are resistant to all countermeasures.\n\nAccording to Jean Valnet, MD, Thyme oil may be effective for killing the anthrax bacillus. Two highly antimicrobial phenols in Thyme, carvacrol and thymol, are responsible for this action.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Ravintsara", "Thyme", "Oregano", "Plectranthus Oregano", "Clove", "Cinnamon", "Citronella", "Lemongrass"], suggestedOilBlends: ["Raven", "Exodus II", "Thieves", "The Gift", "ImmuPower", "Melrose", "Longevity"]),

            illness(name: "Osteoarthritis", description: "Osteoarthritis involves the breakdown of the cartilage that forms a cushion between two joints. As this cartilage is eaten away, the two bones of the joint start rubbing together and wearing down.\n\nIn contrast, rheumatoid arthritis is caused from a swelling and inflammation of the synovial membrane, the lining of the joint.\n\nNatural anti-inflammatories such as German Chamomile and Wintergreen when combined with cartilage builders (glucosamine/chondroitin) are powerful, natural cures for arthritis.\n\nThe best natural anti-inflammatories include fats rich in omega-3s and essential oils such as Nutmeg, Wintergreen, German Chamomile, and Idaho Balsam Fir. The best cartilage builders include Type II collagen and glucosamine contained in BLM powder.\n\nNutmeg, a source of myristicin, has been researched for its anti-inflammatory effects in several studies. It works by inhibiting pro-inflammatory prostaglandins when taken internally or applied topically. Clove exhibits similar action.\n\nChamazulene, the blue sesquiterpene in German Chamomile, also shows strong anti-inflammatory activity when used both topically and orally.\n\nMethyl salicylate is a major compound in Wintergreen, similar to the active agent in aspirin that is found naturally in PanAway. It has strong anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.\n\nGlucosamine and chondroitin are the two most powerful natural compounds for rebuilding cartilage and are the key ingredients in the supplement BLM.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Wintergreen", "Peppermint", "Vetiver", "Valerian", "Palo Santo", "Idaho Balsam Fir", "Eucalyptus Globulus", "Sacred Frankincense", "Frankincense", "Frereana Frankincense", "Idaho Ponderosa Pine", "German Chamomile", "Helichrysum", "Dorado Azul"," Spruce", "Pine"], suggestedOilBlends: ["PanAway", "Relieve It", "Aroma Siez", "Deep Relief Roll-On"]),
            illness(name: "Rheumatoid Arthritis", description: "Rheumatoid arthritis is a painful, inflammatory condition of the joints marked by swelling, thickening, and inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joint. In contrast, osteoarthritis is characterized by a breakdown of the joint cartilage, without any swelling or inflammation.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disease because it is caused by the body's own immune system attacking the joints.\n\nInflammation from rheumatoid arthritis has been ameliorated by the boswellic acids found in most frankincense species.\n\nOther factos can aggravate arthritis such as:\n-Deficiencies of minerals and other nutrients\n-Microbes and toxins\n-Lack of water intake\n-Eating bread\n\nEssential oils are effective in helping to combat pain and infection. In cases where arthritis is caused by infectious organisms, such as Lyme disease, chlamydia, and salmonella, essential oils may counteract and prevent infection.\n\nHighly antimicrobial essential oils include Mountain Savory, Rosemary, Melaleuca Alternifolia, and Oregano. Essential oils easily pass into the bloodstream when applied topically.\n\nMSM, the main ingredient in the supplement Sulfurzyme, has been documented to be one of the most effective, natural supplements for reducing the pain associated with rheumatism and arthritis.\n\nMSM has been a subject of a number of clinical studies and was used extensively by Ronald Lawrence, MD, in his clinical practice to successfully treat rheumatism and arthritis.\n\nGlucosamine and chondroitin are also powerful, natural compounds for reducing inflammation, halting the progression of arthritis, and rebuilding cartilage. These are the key ingredients in the supplement BLM.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Wintergreen", "Peppermint", "Sacred Frankincense", "Frankincense", "Frereana Frankincense", "Palo Santo", "Vetiver", "Nutmeg", "Clove", "Mountain Savory", "Rosemary", "Melaleuca Alternifolia", "Helichrysum", "Idaho Balsam Fir", "Idaho Ponderosa Pine", "Pine", "Eucalyptus Globulus", "Copaiba", "Myrrh", "Valerian", "Dorado Azul", "Spruce"], suggestedOilBlends: ["PanAway", "Relieve It", "Aroma Siez", "Deep Relief Roll-On"]),

Using twice-a-day inhalation of essential oils, including Vetiver, Cedarwood, and Lavender, Dr. Friedmann was able to achieve clinically significant results in 60 days.\n\nResearchers postulate that essential oils mitigate ADD and ADHD through their stimulation of the limbic system of the brain.\n\nBecause attention deficit disorder may be caused by mineral deficiencies in the diet, increasing nutrient intake and absorption of magnesium, potassium, and other trace minerals can also have a significant, beneficial effect in resolving ADD.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Vetiver", "Lavender", "Cedarwood", "Sandalwood", "Cardamom", "Peppermint", "Sacred Frankincense", "Frankincense"], suggestedOilBlends: ["Brain Power", "Peace & Calming", "Clarity"]),
            illness(name: "Autism", description: "Improving diet can be the key to reducing the problems associated with autism. Eliminating refined and synthetic sugars and replacing them with natural sweeteners such as Blue Agave, natural fruit sweeteners, maple syrup, etc., has produced outstanding results in numerous cases of autism.\n\nAutism is a neurologically based bevelopmental disorder that is four times more common in boys than girls. It is characterized by the following:\n- Social ineptness (loner)\n- Nonverbal and verbal communication difficulties\n- Repetitive behavior (rocking, hair twirling)\n- Self-injurious behavior (head banging)\n- Very limited or peculiar interests\n- Reduced or abnormal responses to pain, noises, or other outside stimuli\n\nAutism is being increasingly linked to certain vaccinations; and MMR, the one-shot combination for measles, mumps, and rubella, is most often cited by researchers. British researcher Andrew Wakefield, MD, suggests using single shots for children for measles, mumps, and rubella (instead of the combined MMR shot) until further research is done.\n\nDr. Wakefield's suggestions may be acceptable to people who know little about vaccinations, but the research that has been done on vaccines sends a very loud warning. Vaccinations given in combination or singularly are damaging to anyone of any age. Unfortunately, children are usually the innocent victims who suffer the most.\n\nUntil very recently, children were receiving large doses of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative that contains 49.6 percent mercury, which is well above the limit recommended by the EPA through vaccination. Some success in reversing autism has resulted through mercury detoxification along with nutritional supplementation.\n\nSome researchers believe that gastrointestinal disorders may be linked to the brain dysfunctions that cause autism in children. In fact, there have been several cases of successful treatment of autism using pancreatic enzymes.\n\nStimulation of the limbic region of the brain may also help treat autism. The aromas from essential oils have a powerful ability to stimulate this part of the brain, since the sense of smell is tied directly to the emotional centers. As a result, the aroma of an essential oil has the potential to exert a powerful influence on disorders such as ADD and autism.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Vetiver", "Patchouli", "Lavender", "Eucalyptus Globulus", "Melissa", "Cedarwood", "Sandalwood", "Frankincense"], suggestedOilBlends: ["Brain Power", "GLF", "Valor", "Valor Roll-On", "Clarity", "Peace & Calming", "Common Sense", "The Gift"]),

You cannot tell they are alive unless you look at them with a microscope. They thrive in a moist, warm environment, and when you wake up in the morning, you are astounded at all the bites you have in the most unexpected places.\n\nThe itching is horrible and lasts for about one week. It is amazing that tiny, almost microscopic bug can give such an intense bit. Essential oils are the answer to treating without dreaded chemicals. Some of the oils have a powerful ability to kill on contact. The thought of sleeping with those little, hungry critters is not a pleasant thought, and to some, it's repulsive; but knowing the bugs are dead is a positive feeling.\n\nIf you suspsect bed bugs, wash all of your bedding in hot water and add 10-15 drops of Thieves, Palo Santo, Oregano, Plectranthus Oregano, Thyme, Citrus Fresh, Melrose, etc., and see what works best for you. After you make the bed, spray with a single oil or with one of the blends morning and night to ensure that they do not return.\n\nIf you live in a warm or hot, humid environment, then you will probably have to spray at least once every day or perhaps twice. If you see any little specks, make sure they are not biting bugs that have come to visit.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Palo Santo", "Idaho Tansy", "Eucalyptus Blue"], suggestedOilBlends: []),

Bloating during menstrual cycle or swelling in the lower extremities is caused by pH imbalance and low estrogen. Bloating can also be caused by enzyme deficiencies, resulting in poor digestion and allergies. Swelling in the legs can be from low potassium and poor circulation, which will cause fluid retention.\n\nIt is important to determine whether it is bloating or fluid retention; there is a very significant difference.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Juniper", "Tangerine", "Clary Sage", "Cypress", "Peppermint", "Fennel", "Tarragon", "Nutmeg"], suggestedOilBlends: ["DiGize", "GLF", "Citrus Fresh"]),

Clinical studies by John Lee, MD, showed dramatic increases in bone density using just 20 mg of daily, topically applied progesterone.\n\nCalcium, magnesium, and boron are a few of the msot important minerals for bone health and are usually lacking or deficient in most modern diets. Magnesium is especially important for bone strength, but most Americans consume only a fraction of the 400 mg daily value needed for bone health.\n\nCalcium and magnesium may not be adequately metabolized when consumed because of poor intestinal flora and excess phytates in the diet (a problem with vegetarians). Phytates occur in many nuts, grains, and seeds, including rice. Enzymes like phytase are essential for increasing calcium absorption by liberating calcium from insoluble phytate complexes.\n\nLack of vitamin D has become epidemic among older people and has contributed to a lack of absorption of calcium in the diet.\n\nMegaCal, AlkaLime, and Mineral Essence are all excellent sources of calcium and magnesium, which are essential for strong bones. Mineral Essence in an excellent source of magnesium and other trace minerals.\n\nAvoid drinking anything that is carbonated because it can leach calcium from the bones due to its phosphoric acid content.\n\nStudies show that the majority of women who do resistance training 3-4 times a week do not develop osteoporosis.", suggestedSingleOils: ["Wintergreen", "Idaho Balsam Fir", "Palo Santo", "Sacred Frankincense", "Frankincense", "Thyme", "Cypress", "Peppermint", "Marjoram", "Rosemary", "Basil", "Elemi", "Spruce", "Pine"], suggestedOilBlends: ["ScalarEssence", "PanAway", "Aroma Siez", "Purification", "Melrose", "Sacred Mountain", "Relieve It"]),
